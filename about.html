<h3>About PlotTwist</h3>
<p>The PlotTwist Shiny app plots the data and statistics of time-dependent measurements. The philosophy of the approach is that plotting the raw traces (instead of a summary) improves transparency and interpretation. To further facilitate the comparison, summary statistics (mean) and inferential statistics (confidence intervals) can be added. The user has full control over the visibility of the raw data and statistics by adjustment of the transparency (alpha).</p>

<p>The data can be supplied in spreadsheet/long format (e.g. by copy-pasting from excel). Multiple file upload is supported to upload data from different conditions. </p>

 <p>The data is converted into tidy format. Direct import of tidy data is not supported yet. For more information on the conversion of spreadsheet data to tidy data see <a href="http://thenode.biologists.com/converting-excellent-spreadsheets-tidy-data/education/">this blog</a>.</p>


<p>The plot can be saved as a PDF file, which can be opened and edited with Adobe Illustrator to allow for fine adjustments of the lay-out.</p>
